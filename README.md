# Pyhton Human-Arduino Interface
=====================

Nathanael Spriet

## Description

The aim of that project is to have a whole control of an Arduino plateform, whichever type it is (uno, due, mega...). By "whole control", I mean to control the PinMode (input or output), to activate or not the pullup capacitor for the input pins, to have a feedback on the input pins and to write on the outputs (both analog or digital).
To do it, I have to develop a complete command interpreter for Arduino that will communicate with the PC through the serial link.

## Project Steps

1 : Arduino serial command interpreter

2 : Python IHM (with wx librairy)
